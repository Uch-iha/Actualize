# Question 1
# Exercise: Complete the comments below to keep track of what red, green, and blue are at all times:

red = 3             # red is 3, green doesn't exist, blue doesn't exist
blue = 8            # red is 3, green doesn't exist, blue is 8
green = red + blue  # red is 3, green is 11, blue is 8
red = blue + green  # red is 19, green is 11, blue is 8
green = blue - blue # red is 19, green is 0, blue is 8
red = blue / green  # red is undefined, green is 0, blue is 8
blue = red * green  # red is undefined, green is 0, blue is undefined
red = green + 2     # red is 2, green is 0, blue is undefined
blue = red * 2      # red is 2, green is 0, blue is 4
green = blue * red  # red is 2, green is 8, blue is 4
red = green - blue  # red is 4, green is 8, blue is 4
green = red * green # red is 4, green is 32, blue is 4



# Question 2

# My prediction was right that the code wouldn't run because the "z" variable is undefined



# Question 3

# My prediction was right that the code will excute until it reached the line with the variable that has no definition



# Question 4

# My prediction was right that the code would run without any errors
