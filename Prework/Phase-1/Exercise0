# I've been fascinated with technology ever since I was able to remember.
# I started building computers when I was 12 years old, which lead to my interest in programming.
# I went to the University of Denver to study computer engineering.
# After a year into my studies, I took a break from school and worked at ski resort for two winter seasons.
# I went back to school at the University of Colorado for electrical engineering.
# While I was school, I realized that programming was in high demand and would need to get into the industry before it was to late.
# I want to become a software developer because it has a career that I can express my creativity.
# My goal is to become an excellent software developer to harmonize electronics with a simple interface.
