# Exercise: Fill in the comments below, to keep track of what values woodrow and hannah have on each line:

woodrow = 10                       # woodrow is 10, hannah doesn't exist
woodrow = woodrow - 5              # woodrow is 5, hannah doesn't exsit
woodrow = 17 + woodrow             # woodrow is 22, hannah doesn't exsit
woodrow = woodrow + woodrow + 1    # woodrow is 45, hannah doesn't exsit
hannah = woodrow - 3               # woodrow is 45, hannah is 42
woodrow = woodrow * hannah         # woodrow is 1890, hannah is 42
hannah = woodrow                   # woodrow is 1890, hannah is 1890
woodrow = hannah                   # woodrow is 1890, hannah is 1890
