    <h2 style="color:white">About Tsukuyomi</h2>
    <p style="color:white">Tsukiyomi was the Moon god according the oldest Japanese religion, Shinto, which means "the way of the gods." Tsukiyomi was born from the right eye of the primeval being Izanagi. Tsukiyomi initially lived in the Heavens with his sister, the Sun god, <a href="https://www.windows2universe.org/mythology/amaterasu_sun.html">Amaterasu</a>.</p>
    <p style="color:white">But once, Amaterasu sent her brother as her representative to the goddess of food, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uke_Mochi">Uke Mochi</a>. To celebrate, the goddess of food offered him a wonderful meal, created from her mouth and nose. Tsukiyomi was so disgusted that he killed her. When Amaterasu learned of her brother's misdeed, she was so angry that she did not want to see him anymore. Since then, brother and sister have lived apart, alternating in the sky. That is why the day always follows the night.</p>
